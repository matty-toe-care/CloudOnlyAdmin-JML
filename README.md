## 📘 What is a Custom Extension?

A **custom extension** in Entra Identity Governance is a way to integrate external logic or services into governance workflows.  
They allow you to:  

- Call external APIs or services during identity lifecycle events.  
- Add business-specific rules or automation beyond built-in capabilities.  
- Provide flexibility for unique organizational requirements.  

Think of them as "hooks" that let you extend Entra workflows with your own logic.

## 🔄 Using Custom Extensions in Lifecycle Workflows

Lifecycle workflows in Entra Identity Governance automate identity-related tasks such as onboarding, offboarding, and role changes.  
Custom extensions can be used to:  

- Trigger external processes when a user joins, leaves, or changes roles.  
- Notify third-party systems (e.g., HR, ITSM, or ticketing platforms).  
- Enforce organization-specific compliance checks.  
- Automate provisioning/deprovisioning in non-native systems.  

**Example Use Cases:**  

- Automatically send a welcome package request to HR when a new employee is onboarded.  
- Call an external API to disable accounts in a legacy system during offboarding.  
- Trigger a workflow to update a badge access system when a user changes departments.

## 🎟️ Using Custom Extensions in Entitlement Management

Entitlement Management in Entra Identity Governance helps manage access packages and approvals.  
Custom extensions can enhance this by:  

- Adding external approval logic (e.g., checking a compliance system before granting access).  
- Sending notifications to external systems when access is granted or revoked.  
- Logging entitlement decisions into third-party audit systems.  
- Enforcing additional business rules beyond built-in policies.  

**Example Use Cases:**  

- Require an external risk check before approving access to sensitive applications.  
- Notify a manager via a custom system when an access package is assigned.  
- Record entitlement decisions in a custom database for audit purposes.
